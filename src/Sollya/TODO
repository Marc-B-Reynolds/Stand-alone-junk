This is very hacky. List of things I'll probably never get around to

Approximations (approx.sollya)
* improve and extend approx with constraints

HTML plotting (plotly.sollya)
* emit javascript to generate and share 'x' coord of error plots with
  the same range and sample points
* make the TeX function configurable (rational vs integer x 2^e) code
  is already in approx.sollya
