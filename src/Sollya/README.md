[Sollya](http://sollya.gforge.inria.fr) is a DSL for creating numeric functions.

This is a *helper* library of very questionable value which I tossed to together from various scripts that I've written.  It's totally useless as is since there's no documentation, meaningful examples and features are only half-implemented.
